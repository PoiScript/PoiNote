At any point $P$ the magnitude of the magnetic field intensity produced by the differential element proportional to the product of the current, the magnitude o the differential lenght, and the side of the angle lying between the filament and a line connecting the flament to the point $P$ at which the field is desired.

The magnitude of the magnetic field intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the differential element to the point $P$.

The direction of the magnetic field intensity in normal to the plane containing the differential filament and the line draw from the filament to the point $P$.

The Biot-Savart law can be written concisely using vector notation as:

$$d\vec{H}=\frac{Id\vec{L}\times\vec{a}_R}{4\pi{R}^2}=\frac{Id\vec{L}\times\vec{R}}{4\pi{R}^3}$$

The unit of the magnetic field intensity $H$ are evidently amperes per meter (A/m).

> The law of Biot-Savart is sometimes called Ampere's law for the current element.
