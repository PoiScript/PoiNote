If we consider one charge fixed in position, and move a second charge slowly around, the second charge is displaying the existence of a force field that is associated with charge, $Q_1$.

Call the second charge a test charge $Q_t$. The force on it is given by Comlomb's law:

$$E_t=\frac{F_t}{Q_1}=\frac{Q_1}{4\pi\epsilon_0R^2_{1t}}\vec{a}_{1t}$$
