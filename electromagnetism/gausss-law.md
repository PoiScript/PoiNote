The electric flux passing throught any closed surface is equal to the total charge enclosed by the surface.

$$\Psi=\int d\Psi=\oint\vec{D}_S\cdot\vec{S}$$

The result integral is a closed surface integral, and since the surface element $d\vec{S}$ always involves the differentials of two coordinates, such as $dxdy$, $\rho d\phi d\rho$ or $r^2\sin\theta d\theta d\phi$, the integral is a double integral.

# The point form of Gauss's law

The relation between electric flux denesity and charge density:

$$\text{div}\vec{D}=\rho_v$$

This is the first of Maxwell's four equantions as they apply to electrostatics and steady magnetic fields, and it states the electric flux per unit volume leaving a vanishingly small volume unit exactly equal to the volume charge density there. The equantion is aptly called the point form of Gauss's law.

Gauss's law relates the flux leaving any closed surface to the charge enclosed, and Maxwell's first equantion makes an identical statement on a per-unit-volume basis for a vanishingly small volume, or at a point. Because the divergence may be expressed as the sum of three partial derivatives. Maxwell's first equation is also described as the differential-equantion form of Gauss's law, and conversely, Gauss's law is recognized as the integral form of Maxwell's first equation.
