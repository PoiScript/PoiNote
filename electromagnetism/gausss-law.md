The electric flux passing throught any closed surface is equal to the total charge enclosed by the surface.

\[\Psi=\int d\Psi=\oint\vec{D}_S\cdot\vec{S}\]

The result integral is a closed surface integral, and since the surface element $d\vec{S}$ always involves the differentials of two coordinates, such as $dxdy$, $\rho d\phi d\rho$ or $r^2\sin\theta d\theta d\phi$, the integral is a double integral.
