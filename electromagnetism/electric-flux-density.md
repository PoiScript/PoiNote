The electric flux density $\vec{D}$ is a vector and is a member of the "flux denesity" class of vector field, as opposed to the "force field" class, which includes the electric field intensity $\vec{E}$. The direction of $\vec{D}$ at a point is the direction of the flux lines at that point, and the magnitude is given by the number of flux lines crossing a surface normal to the lines divided by the surface area.

In free space $\vec{D}$ is directly proportional to $\vec{E}$,

\[\vec{D}=\epsilon_0\vec{E}\]

> It does not seem that is should really necessary to introduce a new symbol, but there are a few reasons: First $\vec{D}$ is associated with the flux concept, which is an important new idea. Second the $\vec{D}$ fiedls we obtain will be a little simpler than the corresponding $\vec{E}$ fields because $\epsilon_0$ does not appear.
